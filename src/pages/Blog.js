      title: "Building My First Major Web App: The Product Website",
      summary: "A project to test my front-end skills by creating a complete product website.",
      content: `
As a web development student, I wanted to challenge myself with a project that would simulate a real-world e-commerce application. I decided to build a mock product website for learning purposes.

While this project is front-end-only, it gave me valuable experience in building a polished user interface without relying on a back-end server to manage databases or payments. This taught me how much complexity exists on the client side.

**The Challenge**  
My goal was to create a clean, fully responsive website that included:
- A home page
- Product gallery with multiple items
- Dedicated page for each product
- Functioning shopping cart simulation
- Smooth, intuitive user experience

**My Technology Stack**  
- **React**: Component-based architecture to break down complex UI into reusable pieces  
- **React Router**: Navigation between pages and dynamic routes for each product  
- **React Hooks (useState, useEffect)**: To manage cart state and product data  
- **CSS**: Clean layout using Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsiveness  

**The Biggest Challenges**  
- **Managing the Shopping Cart**: Handling state across multiple components without a back-end  
- **Dynamic Routing**: Creating unique pages for each product using route parameters  

**What I Learned**  
- Front-end development alone can feel like full-stack due to data flow and state management  
- Components make large projects manageable and reusable  
- User experience and responsive design are crucial for creating an intuitive interface
